PROBLEMS I've faced so far 
1.making the input elements of  the form sit side by side 
   I solved this by encapsulating the label and input elements together  in a div and using the flexbox feature to achive the goal


2.getting the background image to fill the first part of the page was initially not easy
	I solved this by going to w3schools and looking at how the background image is used and i realized that using background size property with cover value did the trick
